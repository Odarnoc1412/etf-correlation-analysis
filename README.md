# etf-correlation-analysis
"Correlation analysis and portfolio efficiency using Brazilian ETFs (BOVA11, IVVB11 and XFIX11) with Python, R, and Business Intelligence tools."

This project is supported by the repository [portfolio-efficiency-etfs](https://github.com/Odarnoc1412/portfolio-efficiency-etfs), which contains the modular scripts, raw datasets, and simulation functions used throughout the analysis.

While etf-correlation-analysis focuses on visualization, storytelling, and exploratory analysis using Python, R, and BI tools, portfolio-efficiency-etfs serves as the technical backbone for:

Data collection and normalization (ETFs, IFIX, Selic Over)

LFT simulation based on daily Selic rates

Efficient frontier and equal-weight portfolio modeling

Modular organization for reuse and scalability
